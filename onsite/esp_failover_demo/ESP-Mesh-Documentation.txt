One important feature of our project is maintaining a level of redundancy at all times.
We think its critical to avoid single points of failure, especially when it comes to transmitting biomedical data, used to evaluate health status.

VERSION DESCRIPTIONS:
Version 1: Consists of two esp-32s running espnow_A and espnow_B. The main feature of this setup is to forward data from A->B,when A fails to connect 
to the internet (and the MQTT server). ESP_A "asks" its neighbor ESP_B, if it has a stable connection to the internet, and if it does, it forwards the data 
to ESP_B. The data being handled in this version is fake bmp (heart rate) data. The ESPs communicate through ESP-NOW. VERSION1-FAILOVER.png shows the data
received by the mqtt broker.

Version 2: This version updates the code of ESP_A, to gather real Polar H10 data through BLE (bmp or heart rate) and forward them to the mqtt, 
but also simulate a loss of connection, in the duration of which data gets forwarded to the mqtt broker through ESP_B, after connection is established (ESP-NOW).
